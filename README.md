# Ethereum-Price-Prediction-Model

The Ethereu Price Prediction Model is built using the LSTM neural network.

The objective for this project is to predict the price of Ethereum accurately.

Model buliding steps:
i) Data Cleaning
ii) Exploratory Data Analysis
iii) Feature Engineering
iv) Designing the LSTM neural network.(Used L1 regularization and early stopping to prevent overfitting)
v) Metrics used to evaluate the model- MSE and RMSE
